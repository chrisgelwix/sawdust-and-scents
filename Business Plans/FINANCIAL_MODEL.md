## 1. Break-Even Analysis - Detailed

### Formula
```
Break-Even Units = Fixed Costs ÷ (Selling Price - Variable Cost)
Break-Even Revenue = Break-Even Units × Selling Price
```

### Calculation
- **Fixed Costs (Monthly):** $8,400
- **Average Selling Price:** $52
- **Average Variable Cost:** $22
- **Contribution Margin:** $30 per unit

**Break-Even Units:** $8,400 ÷ $30 = **280 units/month**  
**Break-Even Revenue:** 280 × $52 = **$14,560/month**

### Break-Even by Product Category

### Cash Flow Summary (3 Years)

| Year | Revenue | COGS | Gross Profit | Operating Expenses | Net Profit | Cumulative |
|------|---------|------|--------------|-------------------|------------|------------|
| Year 1 | $140,920 | $59,620 | $81,300 | $100,800 | ($19,500) | ($19,500) |

### ROI Calculations

#### Simple ROI
```
ROI = (Total Return - Initial Investment) ÷ Initial Investment × 100
ROI = ($178,500 - $150,000) ÷ $150,000 × 100
ROI = 19%
```

#### Adjusted ROI (Time-Weighted)
Using 10% discount rate:
- Year 1: ($19,500) ÷ 1.10 = ($17,727)
- Year 2: $78,000 ÷ 1.10² = $64,463
- Year 3: $120,000 ÷ 1.10³ = $90,158
- **NPV:** $136,894
- **Adjusted ROI:** ($136,894 - $150,000) ÷ $150,000 = **-8.7%**

*Note: Negative adjusted ROI in early years is expected for startup investments. Positive returns begin Year 2+.*

#### Payback Period
- **Cumulative break-even:** Month 18
- **Investment recovery:** Month 24-30
- **Payback Period:** ~2.5 years
